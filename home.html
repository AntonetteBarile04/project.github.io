        What is Cyberbullying?

<h3>

         -Cyberbullying is the use of cell phones, instant messaging, e-mail, chat rooms or social networking<br>
    sites such as Facebook and Twitter to harass, threaten or intimidate someone.Cyberbullying is often<br>
    done by children, who have increasingly early access to these technologies.<br><br>
    Cyberbullying can include such acts as making threats, sending provocative insults or racial or ethnic slurs,
    gay bashing, attempting to infect the victim's computer with a virus and flooding an e-mail inbox with messages.
    If you are a victim, you can deal with cyberbullying to some extent by limiting computer connection time,
    not responding to threatening or defamatory messages, and never opening e-mail messages from sources you do not
    recognize or from known sources of unwanted communications. More active measures include blacklisting
    or whitelisting e-mail accounts, changing e-mail addresses, changing ISPs, changing cell phone accounts
    and attempting to trace the source.<br>
    Cyberbullying is a very serious issue affecting not just the young victims, but also the victims' families, the bully, and those who witness instances of cyberbullying. However, the effect of cyberbullying can be most detrimental to the victim, of course, as they may experience a number of emotional issues that affect their social and academic performance as well as their overall mental health.
